- **🕵️ Smart Stalking**: Track multiple objects like they're going out of style
- **🎯 Precision Analysis**: Ying-shot technology for pixel-perfect examination
- **🌀 Data Twisting**: Transform your data into any format you crave
- **🌈 Multi-Modal Magic**: Combine vision with other senses for richer understanding
- **🌌 Galactic Processing**: Handle data at cosmic scales with Milky Way module

## 📦 Installation

Getting started is sweeter than candy! Here's how to set up your Gummy Worms environment:

```bash
# Clone our candy repository
git clone https://github.com/vidhi-sys/gummy-worms-cv.git
cd gummy-worms-cv

# Create a virtual environment (like a candy wrapper!)
python -m venv gummy_env

# Activate it (unwrap the candy!)
# On Windows:
gummy_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source gummy_env/bin/activate

# Install all the sweet dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

Here's a taste of how sweet our code is:

```python
from gummy_worms import Stalker, YingShot, Twizzlers
import cv2

# Initialize our candy helpers
stalker = Stalker()       # 🕵️ Finds the good stuff
ying_shot = YingShot()    # 🎯 Examines it closely
twizzlers = Twizzlers()   # 🌀 Makes it useful

# Load your delicious image
image = cv2.imread('candy_feast.jpg')

# Detect all the sweet objects
detections = stalker.detect(image)

# Analyze them in detail
analysis = ying_shot.analyze(detections)

# Transform into your preferred format
output = twizzlers.transform(analysis)

# Enjoy the results!
cv2.imshow('Candy Detection Results', output)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

We're as fast and accurate as a kid spotting candy:

| Model | mAP@0.5 | Precision | Recall | FPS | Sweetness Level |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| YOLOv5s | 0.89 | 0.91 | 0.87 | 45 | 🍬🍬🍬 |
| YOLOv5m | 0.92 | 0.93 | 0.90 | 32 | 🍬🍬🍬🍬 |
| Custom | 0.94 | 0.95 | 0.92 | 28 | 🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬 |
